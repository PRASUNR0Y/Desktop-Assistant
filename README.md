# Desktop-Assistant
In this lockdown period I used my Python skills and made a Desktop Assistant. 
It is same as Google Assistant which we use in our phones. 
It works over user's voice commands. 
You can control your system with your voice command.  

**It can:** 
* [x] 0. Can be ran all the time on a machine and responds to the hotword "suzie".
* [x] 1. Open and close any application of system. 
* [x] 2. Search anything on Google or Youtube. 
* [x] 3. Able to speak time & date. 
* [x] 4. Send email through voice commands. 
* [x] 5. Play or Stop music in our system. 
* [ ] 6. Solve any algebraic and mathematical problems. 
* [x] 7. Restart, Sleep or Shut Down the system. 

And many more features.
